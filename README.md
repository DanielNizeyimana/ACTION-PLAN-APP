Hello sir, We sent to you our CAT2_mini_project which is ACTION PLAN-APP.
This project help us to plan our goals or tasks that will perfomed at a given time and helps to make evaluation.
In evaluation we see tasks that have been completed or successful, failed and pending.
Firstly, to use this APP you must be logged in, after logging in you can add task, view task, report and log out.
In add task you put title of task, description,end date, label and status.
While in view tasks you see the task that have been added and can be modified means that you can edit or delete some tasks.
In this project, the database has two tables:todo and user.


We worked as two members: 19RP02485(Theogene SINZINKAYO) and 19RP00028(Daniel NIZEYIMANA).
Thank you!!!!
